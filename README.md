# chatGPT Console

This is a little test with ChatGPT. The code has been written in C# using Visual Studio. There is nothing really exciting here - just an application to have fun playing with ChatGPT for a while. You need to get your own access to OpenAI by putting your own private key in this unique script (line 172). I used C# because it makes it easier to integrate a HTTP request. As a single include the code requires Newtonsoft.Json - no more (take a look at the csproj file). I hope that it could help someone. Have fun ++
